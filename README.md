## Buienradar gadget for Windows 7

Made this back in 2016, not sure if it still works on the latest WIn7. I believe, newer updated versions of WIndows 7 have gadgets disabled because of a security flaw if I am correct.
I think the service "Windows Gadget Platform" is now disabled by default (not sure). This is because the html code is executed by a old IE version baked in Windows.
I've tested it on a older system, still works.

It runs the gif file from the buienradar api, you can also zoom in. 

## It uses

* jquery-1.8.3.min
* jquery.elevatezoom
